TRANSLITERATION OF NEPALI UNICODE TO ROMAN

Above program accepts nepali unicode as input and outputs the romanized english words that sound similar to the entered nepali text.

SAMPLE:
nepali : नमस्कार ! के छ खबर ?
roamn : namaskara ! ke chha khabara ?

HEre, i have used a very basic approach to transliterate string. 
The program reads each character one by one and searches for the corresponding value for that particular charcter in lookup table and substitute the romanized equivalent characters that sounds similar.
Hence after iterating and replacing each charcter with its equivalence results the romanized english sentence.
